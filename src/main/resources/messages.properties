help=I can help you store and search your media files such as photos, videos and documents.\n\n<b>Save</b>\n\nYou can save the file in two ways:\n\n<b>1.</b> Send me a text message, then send me a photo, video, sticker or any other file - the file will be saved with a message text as tag that you can use later to search for those files. This can be also used when you forward me a message from a chat or channel.\n\n<b>2.</b> Send me a photo, video, sticker or any other file with a caption in one message - the file will be saved with the caption as tag, which you can use later to search for those files. If both a caption and a message are used, the message will take precedence.\n\n<b>Search</b>\n\nTo search for saved files, type my username @%s in any chat. Without prompting, you will see the last saved files, in different case the bot will search for your files by typed text.\n\n<b>Delete</b>\n\nTo delete a saved file, send it to me without tags.\n\n<b>Random search</b>\n\nTo perform a random search, enter the <b>*</b> symbol. You can update the result by adding spaces to the query text.\n\n<b>Wildcard searches</b>\n\nTo perform a single character wildcard search use the <b>?</b> symbol.\n\nTo perform a multiple character wildcard search use the <b>*</b> symbol.\n\nThe single character wildcard search looks for terms that match that with the single character replaced. For example, to search for <b>text</b> or <b>test</b> you can use the search:\n\n<pre>\tte?t</pre>\n\nMultiple character wildcard searches looks for 0 or more characters. For example, to search for <b>test,</b> <b>tests</b> or <b>tester</b>, you can use the search:\n\n<pre>\ttest*</pre>\n\nYou can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term.\n\n<pre>\tte*t</pre>\n\nFor more information please visit <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/8_5_2/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#Overview">overview of Apache Lucene query parser syntax</a>.\n\n<b>Files</b>\n\nThe following file types are currently supported:
