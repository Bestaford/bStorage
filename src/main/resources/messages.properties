help=I can help you store and search your media files such as photos and videos.\n\nYou can save the file in two ways:\n\n<b>1.</b> Send me a text message followed by a photo or video - the file will be saved with a message text as tags that you can later use to search for those files. This can be useful when you forward me a message from a chat or channel.\n\n<b>2.</b> Send me a photo or video with a caption - the file will be saved with the caption as tags, which you can later use to search for those files. If both a caption and a message are present, the message will take precedence.\n\nTo search for saved files, type my username @%s in any chat. Without prompting, you will see the last saved files, otherwise the bot will search for files by typed text.
command.unknown=Unrecognized command. See /help.
file.saved=File saved without tags.
file.saved.tags=File saved with tags "%s".
