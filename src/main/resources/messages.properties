help=I can help you store and search your media files such as photos, videos and documents.\n\n<b>Save:</b> you can save the file in two ways.\n\n<b>1.</b> Send me a text message, next send me a photo or a video - the file will be saved with a message text as tag that you can use later to search for those files. This can be also used when you forward me a message from a chat or channel.\n\n<b>2.</b> Send me a photo or video with a caption in one message - the file will be saved with the caption as tag, which you can use later to search for those files. If both a caption and a message are used, the message will take precedence.\n\n<b>Search: </b>to search for saved files, type my username @%s in any chat. Without prompting, you will see the last saved files, in different case the bot will search for your files by typed text.\n\n<b>Wildcard searches</b>\n\nTo perform a single character wildcard search use the "?" symbol.\nTo perform a multiple character wildcard search use the "*" symbol.\nThe single character wildcard search looks for terms that match that with the single character replaced. For example, to search for "text" or "test" you can use the search:\n<pre>te?t</pre>\nMultiple character wildcard searches looks for 0 or more characters. For example, to search for test, tests or tester, you can use the search:\n<pre>test*</pre>\nYou can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term.\n<pre>te*t</pre>\nNote: You cannot use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search.
