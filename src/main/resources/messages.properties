help=I can help you store and search your media files such as photos and videos.\n\nYou can save the file in two ways:\n\n<b>1.</b> Send me a text message, next send me a photo or a video - the file will be saved with a message text as tag that you can use later to search for those files. This can be also used when you forward me a message from a chat or channel.\n\n<b>2.</b> Send me a photo or video with a caption in one message - the file will be saved with the caption as tag, which you can use later to search for those files. If both a caption and a message are used, the message will take precedence.\n\nTo search for saved files, type my username @%s in any chat. Without prompting, you will see the last saved files, in different case the bot will search for your files by typed text.
